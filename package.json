  "description": "We have made a copy of the game WORDLE by NYT.  \r The game is deployed on github pages, on the link: https://shishirgujarey.github.io/CS455/  \r The aim of the game is to guess a random 5-letter word in 6 attempts. For each guessed word, a letter in the correct place changes to green, a letter that is present in the word but is at the wrong place turns Yellow, and a letter which is not present in the word turns grey.  \r You can load a new game by clicking the button at the bottom of the page.",
